This is a note web application with both frontend and backend functionality. Users can create, edit, and delete notes. I used Express.js and MongoDB for the backend, and tested API requests using Postman. Additionally, I used Redis as middleware to implement rate limiting for API requests over a specified time period.

Backend tools and libraries used: Express.js | MongoDB | Mongoose | Upstash/Redis | Upstash/Ratelimit | Postman | Dotenv
